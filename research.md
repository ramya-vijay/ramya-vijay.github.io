# Research

My research focuses on:

- Electromagnetic skins and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)  
- Gap waveguide antennas for RF and 6G applications  
- IoT and AI-enabled RF system design  
- Adaptive beam-forming and vehicular wireless communications  

**Recent Publications:**  
- *Reflective metasurface for 5G and beyond Wireless communications*, Sci Rep, 2025.  
- *Complementary Loop Integrated Metasurface for 6G THz Communication*, IEEE Access, 2024.
